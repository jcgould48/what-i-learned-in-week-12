## What I Learned In Week 12

When you make functions using const, the order they appear is very important.


Ith is often a good idea to have individual sheets for each function to make your code easier to decipher and edit.  When doing this you have to be careful about the order they are loaded into the HTML.

Add links to function pages at the end of the body element using a script element.

```javascript
<script src="./helper.js"></script>
```
Manipulating the DOM versus storing the data.  For some apps the data may not to be stored but as we build more complex apps it will be important to store the data in arrays and objects.

Bootstrap and other sights are resources online for access to quick CSS items.  By putting the link in your HTML, you can easily add code that adds new features and style to a webpage or app.
